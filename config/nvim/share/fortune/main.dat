We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost's
familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling
is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great
speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road — the one less
traveled by — offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that
assures the preservation of the earth.

One farmer says to me, 'You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it
furnishes nothing to make bones with;' and so he religiously devotes a part of
his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the
while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and
his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle.

We’re going away. Pack your shit, folks. We’re going away. And we won’t leave
much of a trace, either. Maybe a little Styrofoam … The planet’ll be here and
we’ll be long gone. Just another failed mutation. Just another closed-end
biological mistake. An evolutionary cul-de-sac. The planet’ll shake us off like
a bad case of fleas.

These movies seduce audiences with images of men in the process of growing up,

If the intention behind work is to seek recognition and power - "hey, look at
me, I'm special, I'm important, I'm worthy of your love and respect" - then you
are setting yourself apart from others as a way of trying to feel connected to
them. Setting yourself apart from others as a way of trying to feel connected
to them: It seems so clear why this is self-defeating, and yet it is often the
norm in our culture.

Men need to hear that their souls matter and that the care of their souls is
the primary task of their being. Were all men seeking to uncover a greater
soulfulness in their lives rather than seeking power through a dominator model,
then the world as we know it would be transformed for the better.

The feeling that I have done something wrong, that I really don't know what it
is, that there's something terribly wrong with my very being, leads to a sense
of utter hopelessness. This hopelessness is the deepest cut of the mystified
state. It means there is no possibility for me as I am; there is no way I can
matter or be worthy of anyone's love as long as I remain myself. I must find a
way to be someone else - someone who is lovable. Someone who is not me.

Work is often the space where men detach from feelings. Zukav and Francis
describe workaholism as a flight from emotions: "It is a drug that is as
effective as the most powerful anesthetic...Workaholism is a deep sleep. It is
a self induced trance that temporarily keeps painful emotions away from your
awareness." At the moment when the addictions stop keeping the pain at bay,
many men sink into depression.

My body contains as much anger as water. It is the material from which I have

He lowered his chin and held his arms out like a glider, and every few steps he

And there is a sense in that, for nobody knows of me, and if anyone knew he

Furthermore, as systems of doctrine, symbolism, and behavior, religions harden
into institutions that must command loyalty, be defended and kept "pure", and -
because all belief is fervent hope, and thus a cover-up of doubt and
uncertainty

  nagging insecurity about our position.

Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual suicide; it is
positive unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision of the world.

Atherosclerosis is considered a systemic disorder that uniformly affects all
major blood vessels in the body. Hardening of the arteries can lead to
softening of the penis, since stiffened arteries can't relax open and let blood
flow. Thus, erectile dysfunnction may just be the flaccid tip of the iceberg in
terms of a systemic disorder (30). For two-thirds of men showing up at
emergency rooms with crushing chest pain, their penises had been trying to warn
them for years that something was wrong with their circulation (31).

In every war, up to and including the present one in Iraq, polititians and
military leaders have sought to mobilize their people by reminding them that
they are engaging in way under divine order and protection. War must appear so

daughters and the assumption of the burdensome roles of avenging angel and
mystic warrior.

Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the

Many soldiers' most devastating lesson is the discovery that we are not, after all, the good cavalry led by John Wayne to save the helpless settlers from savages; nor are we the blessed crusaders slaying the turbaned barbarians from Evil Empires. Instead, what soldiers often discover is that those we are trying to save see us as the savage invaders, needing to be stopped by their own painful, heroic sacrifices. When women and children are willing to die to stop us, and we cannot distinguish between enemies and civilians because an entire population resists us, then our soldiers' belief in our goodness cracks - and so does their spirit.
