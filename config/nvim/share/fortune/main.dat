We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads
 in Robert Frost's familiar poem, they are not equally fair.
 The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy, a
 smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed,
 but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road —
 the one less traveled by — offers our last, our only chance
 to reach a destination that assures the preservation of the
 earth.

One farmer says to me, 'You cannot live on vegetable food
 solely, for it furnishes nothing to make bones with;' and
 so he religiously devotes a part of his day to supplying
 his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the
 while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made
 bones, jerk him and his lumbering plow along in spite of
 every obstacle.

We’re going away. Pack your shit, folks. We’re going away.
 And we won’t leave much of a trace, either. Maybe a little
 Styrofoam … The planet’ll be here and we’ll be long gone.
 Just another failed mutation. Just another closed-end
 biological mistake. An evolutionary cul-de-sac. The
 planet’ll shake us off like a bad case of fleas.

Hey it's good to be a young man
And to live the way you please
Yes a young man is the king of ev'ry kingdom that he sees
But there's an old and feeble man not far behind
Oh that surely will catch up to him
Somewhere along the line

A great democracy has got to be progressive,
 or it will soon cease to be either great or a democracy.

Books for the general reader are always ill-smelling books,
the odour of paltry people clings to them.

Where the populace eat and drink, and even where they reverence,
it is accustomed to stink.

One should not go into churches if one wishes to breathe pure air.

It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.
Life is long enough, and sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for
the highest achievements if it were all well invested

A frightened sailor with a bucket is probably the most effective short-term answer
 to getting rid of unwanted water. This is, however, extremely exhausting for long
 periods and a pump is a better approach.
