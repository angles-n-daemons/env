We stand now where two roads diverge. But unlike the roads in Robert Frost's
familiar poem, they are not equally fair. The road we have long been traveling
is deceptively easy, a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great
speed, but at its end lies disaster. The other fork of the road — the one less
traveled by — offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that
assures the preservation of the earth.

One farmer says to me, 'You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it
furnishes nothing to make bones with;' and so he religiously devotes a part of
his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking all the
while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk him and
his lumbering plow along in spite of every obstacle.

We’re going away. Pack your shit, folks. We’re going away. And we won’t leave
much of a trace, either. Maybe a little Styrofoam … The planet’ll be here and
we’ll be long gone. Just another failed mutation. Just another closed-end
biological mistake. An evolutionary cul-de-sac. The planet’ll shake us off like
a bad case of fleas.

Books for the general reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour of paltry
people clings to them.

Where the populace eat and drink, and even where they reverence, it is
accustomed to stink.

One should not go into churches if one wishes to breathe pure air.

It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life
is long enough, and sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the
highest achievements if it were all well invested.

A frightened sailor with a bucket is probably the most effective short-term
answer to getting rid of unwanted water. This is, however, extremely exhausting
for long periods and a pump is a better approach.

To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very

And yet this very singleness of vision and thorough one-ness with his age is a
mark of the successful man. It is as though Nature must needs make men narrow in
order to give them force.

"John," she said, "does it make every one—unhappy when they study and learn lots
of things?"

He paused and smiled. "I am afraid it does," he said.

"And, John, are you glad you studied?"

"Yes," came the answer, slowly but positively.

These movies seduce audiences with images of men in the process of growing up,
but then they betray their characters and us by never letting these men live.
They echo the patriarchal message that if a man stops work, he loses his reason
for living.

If the intention behind work is to seek recognition and power - "hey, look at
me, I'm special, I'm important, I'm worthy of your love and respect" - then you
are setting yourself apart from others as a way of trying to feel connected to
them. Setting yourself apart from others as a way of trying to feel connected to
them: It seems so clear why this is self-defeating, and yet it is often the norm
in our culture.

Men need to hear that their souls matter and that the care of their souls is the
primary task of their being. Were all men seeking to uncover a greater
soulfulness in their lives rather than seeking power through a dominator model,
then the world as we know it would be transformed for the better.

The feeling that I have done something wrong, that I really don't know what it
is, that there's something terribly wrong with my very being, leads to a sense
of utter hopelessness. This hopelessness is the deepest cut of the mystified
state. It means there is no possibility for me as I am; there is no way I can
matter or be worthy of anyone's love as long as I remain myself. I must find a
way to be someone else - someone who is lovable. Someone who is not me.

Work is often the space where men detach from feelings. Zukav and Francis
describe workaholism as a flight from emotions: "It is a drug that is as
effective as the most powerful anesthetic...Workaholism is a deep sleep. It is a
self induced trance that temporarily keeps painful emotions away from your
awareness." At the moment when the addictions stop keeping the pain at bay, many
men sink into depression.

My body contains as much anger as water. It is the material from which I have
built my house: blood red bricks that cry in the rain...It is the face and
posture I show the world. It is the way, sometimes the only way, I am granted an
audience. It is sometimes the way I show affection.

He lowered his chin and held his arms out like a glider, and every few steps he
would jump, the way children do, hoping running will turn to flying. It might
have seemed rediculous to anyone watching, this white haired maintenance worker,
all alone, making like an airplane. But the running boy is inside every man, no
matter how old he gets.

And there is a sense in that, for nobody knows of me, and if anyone knew he
would not know where I could be found, and if he knew where I could be found he
would not know how to deal with me, he would not know how to help me. The
thought of helping me is an illness that has to be cured...

Nevertheless, wonder is not a disease. Wonder, and its expression in the poetry

Furthermore, as systems of doctrine, symbolism, and behavior, religions harden
into institutions that must command loyalty, be defended and kept "pure", and -
because all belief is fervent hope, and thus a cover-up of doubt and uncertainty
- religions must make converts. The more people who agree with us, the less
  nagging insecurity about our position.

Irrevocable commitment to any religion is not only intellectual suicide; it is
positive unfaith because it closes the mind to any new vision of the world.
Faith is, above all, open-ness - an act of trust in the unknown.

Empty, finite, he knows only that he will soon die. Since this life  has no

The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.”
